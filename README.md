# Days on Earth

Days on Earth is an interactive web platform designed for anyone curious about their personal journey through **time** and space. It takes a user's birthdate and lifestyle details to generate a personalized dashboard that visualizes their life in numbers—from heartbeats and breaths taken to their environmental footprint and distance traveled through the galaxy. It solves the problem of abstracting personal impact and time by turning vague concepts into concrete, relatable, and educational statistics.

## 2. Core Features & Functionality

### Personalized Life Statistics Engine

Instantly calculates unique metrics like total days lived, approximate number of breaths taken, heartbeats, and meals consumed based on the user's age and physical attributes.

### Environmental Impact Analysis

Estimates the user's carbon footprint and water consumption based on their diet and location, helping them understand their personal effect on the planet.

### Cosmic Perspective Tracker

Visualizes the user's journey through space, showing how far they have traveled with the solar system and how many times the moon has orbited Earth during their lifetime.

### Visual Life Breakdown

Presents interactive charts (like a "Life Distribution" donut chart) that break down how the user has spent their time—sleeping, working, looking at screens, etc.

### AI-Powered Historical Context

Uses artificial intelligence to generate a summary of significant changes Earth has undergone since the user was born, providing historical context to their life.

### Local Environmental Discovery

Uses the user's location to find and recommend nearby environmental sites or nature reserves, encouraging real-world engagement.

### Interactive AI Assistant

Includes a built-in chatbot that "knows" the user's statistics, allowing them to ask follow-up questions or explore their data in a conversational way.

## 3. Primary User Workflows

### Workflow 1: Generating the Life Dashboard

**Input:** The user arrives at the homepage and fills out a simple form with their birthdate, country, and basic lifestyle details (like activity level and diet).

**Process:** They click the "Calculate" button. The system processes this data instantly.

**Result:** A comprehensive dashboard loads, displaying their "Days Lived," health metrics (heartbeats, steps), and environmental impact stats.

### Workflow 2: Exploring Environmental Context

**Review:** After viewing their basic stats, the user scrolls to the "Environmental Impact" section.

**Visualization:** They see a trend chart showing how their estimated carbon footprint has grown over the years based on their diet.

**Discovery:** They click a "Find Nearby Sites" button. The browser asks for location permission, and the app lists real-world environmental sites or parks near them to visit.

### Workflow 3: Conversational Deep Dive

**Engage:** Intrigued by a specific stat (e.g., "Galactic Distance"), the user opens the chat window.

**Ask:** They ask, "What does galactic distance mean?"

**Learn:** The AI assistant, already aware of the user's specific data, explains the concept in simple terms and relates it back to their specific age.

## 4. Conceptual Data Flow

### Origin (Inputs)

**User Data:** Information starts with the user entering their birthdate, physical stats (height/weight), and lifestyle choices (diet/activity) into the application.

**Location Data:** Optionally, the browser provides the user's current geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude).

### Transformation (The "Black Box")

**Mathematical Logic:** The system applies standard health and physics formulas to convert the user's age and activity level into estimated metrics (e.g., calculating metabolic rate to estimate calories burned).

**AI Processing:** The system sends the user's profile to an AI engine to generate unique, non-mathematical insights (like "Fun Facts" or historical summaries) customized to their birth year and country.

### Output (Results)

**The final output** is a visual dashboard composed of text statistics, color-coded charts, and AI-written summaries.

**It also produces** an interactive session where the chatbot remembers the generated data to answer context-aware questions.
